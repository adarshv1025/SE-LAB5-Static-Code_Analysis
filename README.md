## üéØ Objective
The objective of this lab is to understand the importance of **static code analysis** in improving software quality.  
This project applies tools like **Pylint**, **Flake8**, and **Bandit** to a Python-based **Inventory Management System** to identify and fix:
- Code style violations (PEP8)
- Logical and runtime errors
- Security vulnerabilities

## üß∞ Tools Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python 3** | Programming language used |
| **Pylint** | Code quality and convention checker |
| **Flake8** | Style guide enforcement tool (PEP8) |
| **Bandit** | Security vulnerability scanner |
| **GitHub Codespaces** | Cloud development environment |
| **VS Code** | Code editor used for development |

## üìù Summary of Work
1. Implemented a Python-based **Inventory Management System** with functionalities to:
   - Add and update inventory items  
   - Track stock quantities and generate reports  
   - Log all activities for auditing  
2. Performed static analysis using **Pylint**, **Flake8**, and **Bandit**.  
3. Fixed all identified issues related to:
   - Naming conventions  
   - File handling and exception safety  
   - Mutable default arguments  
   - Missing docstrings and inconsistent formatting  
   - Insecure use of `eval()`  
4. Generated detailed reports for all tools and verified improvements in readability, maintainability, and security.
